For this assignment I honestly had A LOT of trouble getting things to work and 
understanding what the assignment was asking of me. I spent about 13 hours playing 
around with it friday before the initial due dat and then proceeded to get nowhere. 
I cannot make it to office hours due to taking 18 hours and having classes exactly 
when office hours are. I ended up getting an unworking copy for the cloud formation 
and got the yml files, but I honestly do not know if they work together at this point.
I in total have spent somewhere around 34 hours on this assignment and just go in 
circles. I understand my grade will reflect this but at this point I am stuck at a 
point of being burnt out with AWS in general. 

The process that I did for this assignment started with rewatching the lectures and 
following along. But even when I followed the lecutres step by step I would get a 
(X)ROLLBACK_COMPLETE error. I have tried this in a million different ways, triple 
checked my work, tried doing an aws tutorial, tried watching the lectures several 
times. I honestly did everything in my power to try and get it to give me the 
CREATE_COMPLETE sign, but nothing. Unfortunately, this is all I am able to get done 
with taking 18 hours of classes and having to deal with some health issues. If there 
is an opportunity to make up this grade or get a more firm explanation or 
walk-through I would be completely open to it. But at this moment this is all I can 
get.
